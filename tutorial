Use of # (pound sign)

OGNL is used to refer to objects in the ActionContext as follows:

objectName: object in the ValueStack (default/root object in the OGNL context), such as an Action property
#objectName: object in the ActionContext but outside of the ValueStack, specifically...
#objectName: ActionContext object that has been created using the Struts2 data tags with the default action scope (e.g., <s:set name="foo" value="'Testing'" />, referenced by <s:property value="#foo" />)
#parameters.objectName: request parameter
#request.objectName: request-scoped attribute
#session.objectName: session-scoped attribute
#application.objectName: application-scoped attribute
#attr.objectName: attribute in page, request, session, or application scope (searched in that order)
The scoped map references above (parameters, request, session, and application) can be made one of two ways:

#scopeName.objectName or
#scopeName['objectName']
Use of % (percent sign)

%{ OGNL expression } is used to force OGNL evaluation of an attribute that would normally be interpreted as a String literal.

Example: <s:property value="myProperty" default="%{myDynamicDefaultValue}" />

Use of @ (at sign)

The @ symbol is used to make references to static properties and methods. Note that you may need to enable this in your Struts2 properties: struts.ognl.allowStaticMethodAccess=true
